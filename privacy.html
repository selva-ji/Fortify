        <h1>Privacy Policy for Fortify</h1>

        <p><strong>Last Updated: 06.01.2026</strong></p>

        <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Fortify ("Application") for mobile devices.</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is our top priority. Fortify is designed to be a simple, secure, and transparent application. <strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or data from your device.</strong></p>

        <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>Fortify does not collect, read, or store any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal information such as your name, email address, or contacts.</li>
            <li>Device information, advertising identifiers, or location data.</li>
            <li>Usage statistics or analytics about your interaction with the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>Fortify requires the <strong>Device Administrator</strong> permission for its core functionality. Here is why this permission is necessary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Administrator (BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN):</strong> This permission is required solely to enable the app to lock your device's screen. The app cannot perform any other administrative actions. This permission is only activated when you explicitly grant it within the app, and it can be revoked at any time through your device's system settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All operations are performed locally on your device. No information is sent to us or any third party.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
